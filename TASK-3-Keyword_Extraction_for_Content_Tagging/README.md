# Keyword Extraction Demo

This is a simple demo for extracting keywords from text using NLTK. It automatically pulls out the top 5 keywords based on frequency after cleaning up the text.

## Try it out

Check out the live app here: [https://kyra-keyword-extraction.streamlit.app/](https://kyra-keyword-extraction.streamlit.app/)

Or run locally:
1. Install Python and NLTK.
2. Go to the `app/` folder.
3. Run `streamlit run app.py`.

The notebook `test.ipynb` has examples with sample texts. Pretty straightforward stuff!
