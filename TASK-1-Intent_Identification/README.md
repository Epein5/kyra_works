# Intent Identification Demo

Hey, this is a quick demo of a simple chatbot intent classifier using basic rules. It checks for keywords to figure out if a message is a greeting, booking request, complaint, or something else.

## Try it out

You can test the app online here: [https://kyra-intent-indentificaion.streamlit.app/](https://kyra-intent-indentificaion.streamlit.app/)

Or run it locally:
1. Make sure you have Python and Streamlit installed.
2. Go to the `app/` folder.
3. Run `streamlit run app.py`.

Check out `test.ipynb` for some notebook tests and accuracy checks. It's pretty basic but gets the job done for demos!
